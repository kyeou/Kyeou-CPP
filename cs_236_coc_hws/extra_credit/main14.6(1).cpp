/*
Simulate the processing of customers at a bank with five tellers. Customers arrive on average once per minute, and they need an average of five minutes to complete a transaction. 
Customers enter a queue to wait for the next available teller.
Use two kinds of events. An arrival event adds the customer to the next free teller or the queue and schedules the next arrival event. 
When adding a customer to a free teller, also schedule a departure event. 
The departure event removes the customer from the teller and makes the teller service the next customer in the waiting queue, again scheduling a departure event.
For greater realism, use an exponential distribution for the time between arrivals and the transaction time. 
If m is the desired mean time and r a uniformly distributed random number between 0 and 1, then â€“m log(r) has an exponential distribution.
After each event, your program should print the bank layout, showing empty and occupied tellers and the waiting queue, like this:
C.CC.
if there is no queue, or
CCCCC CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
if there is one. Simulate customer arrivals for 8 hours. 
At the end of the simulation, print the total number of customers served and the average time each customer spent in the bank. 
(Your Customer objects will need to track their arrival time.)
