/*

Implement a base class Account and derived classes Savings and Checking. In the base
class, supply member functions deposit and withdraw. Provide a function daily_
interest that computes and adds the daily interest. For calculations, assume that
every month has 30 days. Checking accounts yield interest of 3 percent annu ally on
balances over $1,000. Savings accounts yield interest of 6 percent annually on the
entire balance. Write a test program that makes a monthâ€™s worth of depos its and
withdrawals and calculates the interest every day
